# Expanded Section: Authentication & User Management

## Overview
Authentication is the backbone of any secure web application. In Lumière Café CMS, authentication is implemented using a serverless approach with localStorage, but the architecture is designed to be easily migrable to any backend (Node.js, Django, etc.).

### Signup Workflow
- **UI/UX:** Signup form with fields for name, email, password, phone. Password field includes a visibility toggle for better UX.
- **Validation:**
  - Email format checked with regex.
  - Password must meet strength requirements (min length, character types).
  - Duplicate email check against existing users in localStorage.
- **Process:**
  - On submit, data is validated client-side.
  - If valid, user object is created with role 'customer' and stored in localStorage.
  - Password is hashed using bcryptjs before storage.
  - Success feedback via toast notification.
- **Extensibility:**
  - Easily replace localStorage with API call to backend.
  - Add email verification, captcha, or OAuth as needed.

### Login Workflow
- **UI/UX:** Login form with email and password fields. Password visibility toggle.
